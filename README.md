# Summary
Code to replicate the main results of the 2019 Nature paper ["An artificial neuron implemented on an actual quantum processor"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02266) which used the IBM Quantum Experience and Qiskit to impement a McCullogh-Pitts Perceptron.

This was my final project for a Quantum Algorithms class I took at the University of Washington (PHYS 576) in Spring 2020.

The project report can be found [in this repository](Lorenz_576_Final_Project.pdf).
