# Summary
Code to replicate the main results of the 2019 Nature paper ["An artificial neuron implemented on an actual quantum processor"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02266)

This was my final project for my Quantum Algorithms class at the University of Washington (PHYS 576) in Spring 2020.

The report can be found [in this repository](Lorenz_576_Final_Project.pdf).
